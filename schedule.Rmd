#### Due
(Before the start of class on Monday)


- Complete Slack Introduction:
  1. Sign-in to our [Slack workspace](https://reedmath243fall2021.slack.com)
  2. Think of your favorite book or movie. Then navigate to the `#general-discussion` channel using the menu on the left side of the screen and post a message with your name and pronouns (if you choose to share), along with 2 facts about yourself, one of which you think will make it *easier* to guess your favorite book or movie, and the other of which you think will make it *harder* to guess (don't say which is which). You will need to monitor your post and respond to yes or no questions about your favorite book / movie. *At the end of the first week, prizes will be awarded to the people whose book / movie was guessed in the fewest and in the greatest number of questions.*
  
  3. Find another another person's post, hover over it, and click the chat bubble icon to start or continue a thread. Then ask a yes or no question that can be used to help deduce the identity of the person's favorite book or movie. Repeat for at least 3 other people.
  4. Finally, find my name (Nate Wells) under Direct Messages on the left side of the screen, and send me a private message answering the following questions:
      a) What is your preferred name? (and what are your pronouns, if you'd like to share?)
      b) How would you rate your proficiency with R?  (Basic / Novice / Intermediate / Advanced / Expert) Briefly describe your previous experience (i.e. what classes you've taken or projects you've completed using R).
      c) What do you hope to take away from this course?
      d) What concerns do you have about this course, or about academics in general this term?
      e) What is one image that best describes you? (feel free to upload it)
